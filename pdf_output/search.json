    "text": "1 Welcome to the Course Computer-Based Physical Modelling!\nThe programming language Python is useful for all kinds of scientific and technical tasks. You can use it to analyze and visualize data. You can also use it to numerically solve scientific problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically. Python is freely available and, due to its modular structure, has been expanded with an almost infinite number of modules for various purposes.\nThis course aims to introduce you to programming with Python. It is primarily aimed at beginners, but we hope it will also be interesting for advanced users. We begin the course with an introduction to the Jupyter Notebook environment, which we will use throughout the entire course. Afterward, we will provide an introduction to Python and show you some basic functions, such as plotting and analyzing data through curve fitting, reading and writing files, which are some of the tasks you will encounter during your physics studies. We will also show you some advanced topics such as animation in Jupyter and the simulation of physical processes in\n\nMechanics\nElectrostatics\nWaves\nOptics\n\nIf there is time left at the end of the course, we will also take a look at machine learning methods, which have become an important tool in physics as well.\nWe will not present a comprehensive list of numerical simulation schemes, but rather use the examples to spark your curiosity. Since there are slight differences in the syntax of the various Python versions, we will always refer to the Python 3 standard in the following.\nThe course will be held in German. However, the web pages that you will be provided for an overview of Python will be in English. Exercise assignments will be given in German.",

We will primarily use this webpage for convenience, but for day-to-day work in the laboratory, it’s beneficial to utilize a code editor or a notebook environment like JupyterLab. JupyterLab is a robust platform that enables you to develop and modify notebooks within a web browser, while also offering comprehensive capabilities for analyzing and visualizing data.\nA Jupyter Notebook is a web browser based interactive computing environment that enables users to create documents that include code to be executed, results from the executed code such as plots and images,and finally also an additional documentation in form of markdown text including equations in LaTeX.\nThese documents provide a complete and self-contained record of a computation that can be converted to various formats and shared with others using email, version control systems (like git/GitHub) or nbviewer.jupyter.org.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Key Components of a Notebook\nThe Jupyter Notebook ecosystem consists of three main components:\n\nNotebook Editor\nKernels\nNotebook Documents\n\nLet’s explore each of these components in detail:\n\n3.1.1.1 Notebook Editor\nThe Notebook editor is an interactive web-based application for creating and editing notebook documents. It enables users to write and run code, add rich text, and multimedia content. When running Jupyter on a server, users typically use either the classic Jupyter Notebook interface or JupyterLab, an advanced version with more features.\nKey features of the Notebook editor include:\n\nCode Editing: Write and edit code in individual cells.\nCode Execution: Run code cells in any order and display computation results in various formats (HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, PDF).\nInteractive Widgets: Create and use JavaScript widgets that connect user interface controls to kernel-side computations.\nRich Text: Add documentation using Markdown markup language, including LaTeX equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvance Notebook Editor Info\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Notebook editor in Jupyter offers several advanced features:\n\nCell Metadata: Each cell has associated metadata that can be used to control its behavior. This includes tags for slideshows, hiding code cells, and controlling cell execution.\nMagic Commands: Special commands prefixed with % (line magics) or %% (cell magics) that provide additional functionality, such as timing code execution or displaying plots inline.\nAuto-completion: The editor provides context-aware auto-completion for Python code, helping users write code more efficiently.\nCode Folding: Users can collapse long code blocks for better readability.\nMultiple Cursors: Advanced editing with multiple cursors for simultaneous editing at different locations.\nSplit View: The ability to split the notebook view, allowing users to work on different parts of the notebook simultaneously.\nVariable Inspector: A tool to inspect and manage variables in the kernel’s memory.\nIntegrated Debugger: Some Jupyter environments offer an integrated debugger for step-by-step code execution and inspection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Kernels\nKernels are the computational engines that execute the code contained in a notebook. They are separate processes that run independently of the notebook editor.\nKey responsibilities of kernels include: * Executing user code * Returning computation results to the notebook editor * Handling computations for interactive widgets * Providing features like tab completion and introspection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Kernel Info\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter notebooks are language-agnostic. Different kernels can be installed to support various programming languages such as Python, R, Julia, and many others. The default kernel runs Python code, but users can select different kernels for each notebook via the Kernel menu.\nKernels communicate with the notebook editor using a JSON-based protocol over ZeroMQ/WebSockets. For more technical details, see the messaging specification.\nEach kernel runs in its own environment, which can be customized to include specific libraries and dependencies. This allows users to create isolated environments for different projects, ensuring that dependencies do not conflict.\nKernels also support interactive features such as:\n\nTab Completion: Provides suggestions for variable names, functions, and methods as you type, improving coding efficiency.\nIntrospection: Allows users to inspect objects, view documentation, and understand the structure of code elements.\nRich Output: Supports various output formats, including text, images, videos, and interactive widgets, enhancing the interactivity of notebooks.\n\nAdvanced users can create custom kernels to support additional languages or specialized computing environments. This involves writing a kernel specification and implementing the necessary communication protocols.\nFor managing kernels, Jupyter provides several commands and options:\n\nStarting a Kernel: Automatically starts when a notebook is opened.\nInterrupting a Kernel: Stops the execution of the current code cell, useful for halting long-running computations.\nRestarting a Kernel: Clears the kernel’s memory and restarts it, useful for resetting the environment or recovering from errors.\nShutting Down a Kernel: Stops the kernel and frees up system resources.\n\nUsers can also monitor kernel activity and resource usage through the Jupyter interface, ensuring efficient and effective use of computational resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 JupyterLab Example\nThe following is an example of a JupyterLab interface with a notebook editor, code cells, markdown cells, and a kernel selector:\nFull Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Notebook Documents\nNotebook documents are self-contained files that encapsulate all content created in the notebook editor. They include code inputs/outputs, Markdown text, equations, images, and other media. Each document is associated with a specific kernel and serves as both a human-readable record of analysis and an executable script to reproduce the work.\nCharacteristics of notebook documents:\n\nFile Extension: Notebooks are stored as files with a .ipynb extension.\nStructure: Notebooks consist of a linear sequence of cells, which can be one of three types:\n\nCode cells: Contain executable code and its output.\nMarkdown cells: Contain formatted text, including LaTeX equations.\nRaw cells: Contain unformatted text, preserved when converting notebooks to other formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Notebook Documents Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Control: Notebook documents can be version controlled using systems like Git. This allows users to track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. Tools like nbdime provide diff and merge capabilities specifically designed for Jupyter Notebooks.\nCell Tags: Cells in a notebook can be tagged with metadata to control their behavior during execution, export, or presentation. For example, tags can be used to hide input or output, skip execution, or designate cells as slides in a presentation.\nInteractive Widgets: Notebook documents can include interactive widgets that allow users to manipulate parameters and visualize changes in real-time. This is particularly useful for data exploration and interactive simulations.\nExtensions: The Jupyter ecosystem supports a wide range of extensions that enhance the functionality of notebook documents. These extensions can add features like spell checking, code formatting, and integration with external tools and services.\nSecurity: Notebook documents can include code that executes on the user’s machine, which poses security risks. Jupyter provides mechanisms to sanitize notebooks and prevent the execution of untrusted code. Users should be cautious when opening notebooks from unknown sources.\nCollaboration: Jupyter Notebooks can be shared and collaboratively edited in real-time using platforms like Google Colab, Microsoft Azure Notebooks, and JupyterHub. These platforms provide cloud-based environments where multiple users can work on the same notebook simultaneously.\nCustomization: Users can customize the appearance and behavior of notebook documents using CSS and JavaScript. This allows for the creation of tailored interfaces and enhanced user experiences.\nExport Options: In addition to static formats, notebooks can be exported to interactive formats like dashboards and web applications. Tools like Voila convert notebooks into standalone web applications that can be shared and deployed.\nProvenance: Notebooks can include provenance information that tracks the origin and history of data and computations. This is important for reproducibility and transparency in scientific research.\nDocumentation: Notebook documents can serve as comprehensive documentation for projects, combining code, results, and narrative text. This makes them valuable for teaching, tutorials, and sharing research findings.\nPerformance: Large notebooks with many cells and outputs can become slow and unwieldy. Techniques like cell output clearing, using lightweight data formats, and splitting notebooks into smaller parts can help maintain performance.\nIntegration: Jupyter Notebooks can integrate with a wide range of data sources, libraries, and tools. This includes databases, cloud storage, machine learning frameworks, and visualization libraries, making them a versatile tool for data science and research.\nInternal Format: Notebook files are JSON text files with binary data encoded in base64, making them easy to manipulate programmatically.\nExportability: Notebooks can be exported to various static formats (HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX, PDF, slide shows) using Jupyter’s nbconvert utility.\nSharing: Notebooks can be shared via nbviewer, which renders notebooks from public URLs or GitHub as static web pages, allowing others to view the content without installing Jupyter.\n\n\n\n\nThis integrated system of editor, kernels, and documents makes Jupyter Notebooks a powerful tool for interactive computing, data analysis, and sharing of computational narratives.",

    "text": "3.2 Using the Notebook Editor\n\n\n\nJupyter Notebook Editor\n\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook editor provides an interactive environment for writing code, creating visualizations, and documenting computational workflows. It consists of a web-based interface that allows users to create and edit notebook documents containing code, text, equations, images, and interactive elements. A Jupyter Notebook provides an interface with essentially two modes of operation:\n\nedit mode the mode where you edit a cells content.\ncommand mode the mode where you execute the cells content.\n\nIn the more advanced version of JupyterLab you can also have a presentation mode where you can present your notebook as a slideshow.\n\n3.2.1 Edit mode\nEdit mode is indicated by a blue cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area when a cell is selected. You can enter edit mode by pressing Enter or using the mouse to click on a cell’s editor area.\n\n\n\nEdit Mode\n\n\nWhen a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor\n\n\n3.2.2 Command mode\nCommand mode is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin. When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells. Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently.\n\n\n\nCommand Mode\n\n\nIf you have a hardware keyboard connected to your iOS device, you can use Jupyter keyboard shortcuts. The modal user interface of the Jupyter Notebook has been optimized for efficient keyboard usage. This is made possible by having two different sets of keyboard shortcuts: one set that is active in edit mode and another in command mode.\n\n\n3.2.3 Keyboard navigation\nIn edit mode, most of the keyboard is dedicated to typing into the cell’s editor area. Thus, in edit mode there are relatively few shortcuts available. In command mode, the entire keyboard is available for shortcuts, so there are many more. Most important ones are:\n\nSwitch command and edit mods: Enter for edit mode, and Esc or Control for command mode.\nBasic navigation: ↑/k, ↓/j\nRun or render currently selected cell: Shift+Enter or Control+Enter\nSaving the notebook: s\nChange Cell types: y to make it a code cell, m for markdown and r for raw\nInserting new cells: a to insert above, b to insert below\nManipulating cells using pasteboard: x for cut, c for copy, v for paste, d for delete and z for undo delete\nKernel operations: i to interrupt and 0 to restart\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Running code\nCode cells allow you to enter and run code. Run a code cell by pressing the ▶︎ button in the bottom-right panel, or Control+Enter on your hardware keyboard.\n\n\n23752636\n\n\nThere are a couple of keyboard shortcuts for running code:\n\nControl+Enter run the current cell and enters command mode.\nShift+Enter runs the current cell and moves selection to the one below.\nOption+Enter runs the current cell and inserts a new one below.",

You can see kernel indicator in the top-right corner reporting current kernel state: ⚪︎ means kernel is ready to execute code, and ⚫︎ means kernel is currently busy. Tapping kernel indicator will open kernel menu, where you can reconnect, interrupt or restart kernel.\nTry running the following cell — kernel indicator will switch from ⚪︎ to ⚫︎, i.e. reporting kernel as “busy”. This means that you won’t be able to run any new cells until current execution finishes, or until kernel is interrupted. You can then go to kernel menu by tapping the kernel indicator and select “Interrupt”.",

In this way, everything really becomes an notebook. You can change the cell type to Markdown by using the “Cell Actions” menu, or with a hardware keyboard shortcut m. Markdown is a popular markup language that is a superset of HTML. Its specification can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet\nMarkdown cells can either be rendered or unrendered.\nWhen they are rendered, you will see a nice formatted representation of the cell’s contents.\nWhen they are unrendered, you will see the raw text source of the cell. To render the selected cell, click the ▶︎ button or shift+ enter. To unrender, select the markdown cell, and press enter or just double click.\n\n3.4.1 Markdown basics\nBelow are some basic markdown examples, in its rendered form. If you which to access how to create specific appearances, double click the individual cells to put the into an unrendered edit mode.\nYou can make text italic or bold. You can build nested itemized or enumerated lists:\n\n\n3.4.2 Markdown lists example\n\nFirst item\n\nFirst subitem\n\nFirst sub-subitem\n\nSecond subitem\n\nFirst subitem of second subitem\nSecond subitem of second subitem\n\n\nSecond item\n\nFirst subitem\n\nThird item\n\nFirst subitem\n\n\nNow another list:\n\nHere we go\n\nSublist\n\nSublist\n\n\nThere we go\nNow this\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Blockquote example\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.

Normal variable names must start with a letter or an underscore. By convention, variable names typically start with a lower-case letter, while Class names start with a capital letter and internal variables start with an underscore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReserved Keywords\n\n\n\nPython has keywords that cannot be used as variable names. The most common ones you’ll encounter in physics programming are:\nif, else, for, while, return, and, or, lambda\nNote that lambda is particularly relevant as it could naturally appear in physics code, but since it’s reserved for anonymous functions in Python, it cannot be used as a variable name.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Variable Assignment\nThe assignment operator in Python is =. Python is a dynamically typed language, so we do not need to specify the type of a variable when we create one.\nAssigning a value to a new variable creates the variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not explicitly specified, a variable does have a type associated with it (e.g., integer, float, string). The type is derived from the value that was assigned to it. To determine the type of a variable, we can use the type function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we assign a new value to a variable, its type can change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we try to use a variable that has not yet been defined, we get a NameError error.",
